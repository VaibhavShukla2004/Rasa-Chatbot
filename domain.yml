        The depositor can use NEFT/RTGS mode for depositing the Challan.
        The Challan (GAR-7)/ Deposit slip can be generated and the amount can be
        remitted to the designated bank by intra-bank transfer or using NEFT/RTGS
        using the format generated by the Bharatkosh system. After successful payment,
        the user has to enter the UTR number on Bharatkosh under the "Track Your Payment" section.

        It should be ensured that while filling up the mandate form and providing details
        like account number and IFSC code, the same account number should be debited while making payment.
        Sometimes users fill one account in the form but pay from another â€” this causes challan failure.
